# Java-MIDI-Player

![MIDI](src/resources/images/midi.gif)

#### This is what I called "Brainwashing MIDIBox", because I may open a MIDI and listen to it for hours.<:/
#### ...Especially after adding MIDI device switching function. Yes, I have VirtualMIDISynth installed and soundfonts as well. 
(so why waiting here go downloading;>)
## Functions
* #### Playing MIDI files (Duh...)
* #### A seekbar, some buttons and... REPEAT SWITCH!!!
* #### A function I added after going through Javadocs for hours: Listing MIDI devices and switching between them (not a playlist huh)
* #### Saving preferences to a file (Window position, preferred MIDI device, etc.)
* #### Coming soon (in 1000yrs =w= )

## Bugs
* #### The "Real Time Sequencer" doesn't work. Someday I may remove it from the list.
* #### More bugs to find (Have been learning Java for 2 days...)

#### This project is open-sourced and licensed under MIT.
(So just IGNORE the comment messsssssssssssss)
#### An Executable JAR have been uploaded.
